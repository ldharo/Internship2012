These are the files necessary for the first round of benchmarks in ifF1WAE.

They have been obtained running script.sh .
Tests were from a previous session.

Results, traces and tests have then been put manually into repertories.
The file test10runs10 only serves to prove the InterpretCps works on very small cases.
